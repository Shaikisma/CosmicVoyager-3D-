# Cosmic Three.js Interactive Experience

![Project Preview]

An interactive 3D web application with scroll-based animations, 3D image displays, and cosmic-themed UI elements built with Three.js.

## Features

- ðŸŒŒ Cosmic-themed Three.js scene with starry background
- ðŸŽš Scroll-triggered animations for circular UI elements
- ðŸ–¼ 3D image carousel with hover effects
- âœ¨ Optional cursor light interaction
- ðŸ“± Responsive design for all screen sizes
- ðŸ’« Cosmic-styled UI components

## Technical Approach

### Core Technologies
- Three.js (r155+) for 3D rendering
- GSAP for smooth animations
- WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics
- CSS3 for UI styling and transitions

### Implementation Highlights
1. **Scene Setup**
   - Created a cosmic environment with particle systems for stars
   - Implemented ambient and directional lighting
   - Added fog effects for depth perception

2. **Scroll Animations**
   - Used scroll event listeners with debouncing
   - Implemented GSAP for smooth easing transitions
   - Created parallax effects for depth

3. **3D Image Display**
   - Arranged images in circular formation using polar coordinates
   - Implemented auto-rotation with Three.js OrbitControls
   - Added hover scaling effects with raycasting

4. **Cursor Interaction**
   - Created a point light that follows mouse position
   - Implemented smooth interpolation for movement
   - Added glow effect with THREE.LensFlare
